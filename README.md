"Background"

"AquaByte is capable of sending several thousands of observations per minute, often at particular times of day. For instance, AquaByte most actively observes in the evening and early morning hours, when certain fish can be seen with higher frequency.

Each row of data sent to the surface by AquaByte is tagged with a primary key: in this case, the exact timestamp of the observation in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS. This happens to be ISO8601 format, if you’re curious!"

"Partitions"

"AquaByte plans to send its six observations to a network of boats on the surface: Boat A, Boat B, and Boat C. More boats allow AquaByte to send more data than any single boat could store. Yet more boats comes at the cost of more complexity: assuming the data, once stored, shouldn’t be moved, to which boat should AquaByte send each observation? This is, in fact, a problem of partitioning the data."



"Random Partitioning"

"One approach is for AquaByte to randomly send its observations to each boat, as per the below. With the questions below, analyze the technical trade-offs of this design decision.

Consider the following two thought questions. Once you have an idea in your head, choose the answer that best corresponds to your thinking by clicking the appropriate dropdown.

Will the observations likely be evenly distributed across all boats, even if AquaByte most commonly collects observations between midnight and 1am? Why or why not?

The observations will be evenly distributed.
The observations will not be evenly distributed.

Suppose a researcher wants to query for all observations between midnight and 1am. On how many of the boats will they need to run the query?

The researcher will need to run the query on all of the boats.
The researcher will need to run the query on only some of the boats.


Based on what you’ve learned from the above, from lecture, and from your own intuition, write 2–3 sentences that describe both reasons to adopt this approach and reasons not to adopt this approach. Write the sentences in answers.md, within the “Random Partitioning” section."



"Partitioning by Hour"

"Suppose, for the reasons you’ve written, the AquaByte team decides not to have AquaByte randomly send its observations to each boat. Instead, a team member proposes that you partition the data by time of day. For instance,

Boat A will receive all observations within the hours of 0–7 (i.e., midnight to 7:59 AM), inclusive.
Boat B will receive all observations within the hours of 8–15 (i.e., 8:00 AM to 3:59 PM), inclusive.
Boat C will receive all observations within the hours of 16–23 (i.e., 4:00 PM to 11:59 PM), inclusive.

"Partitioning by Hash Value"

"Suppose, for the reasons you’ve identified above, the AquaByte team decides not to have AquaByte send observations to certain boats depending on the hour in which they were collected. Instead, a team member proposes that you partition the observations by hash value of their timestamp.

If unfamiliar, a hash value is generated by a hash function. A hash function is an algorithm that takes some input (such as a timestamp, for example) and—based on the input—outputs an arbitrary number (the hash value).

For instance, suppose the team develops a hash function that assigns a value between 0 and 1,499, inclusive, to each possible primary key AquaByte could send to the distributed data system. As examples of inputs and outputs:

The algorithm computes the hash value 45 for 2023-11-01 00:00:01.020.
The algorithm computes the hash value 588 for 2023-11-01 16:21:59.924.
The algorithm computes the hash value 1200 for 2023-11-01 00:00:04.127.
Importantly, the hash function is consistent: it will always compute the same hash value when given the same timestamp. The hash function also distributes timestamps evenly across all possible hash values: that is, a single observation is no more likely to be assigned one hash value than another. With the questions below, analyze the technical trade-offs of this design decision.

Consider the following three thought questions. Once you have an idea in your head, choose the answer that best corresponds to your thinking by clicking the appropriate dropdown.

Will the observations likely be evenly distributed across all boats, even if AquaByte most commonly collects observations between midnight and 1am? Why or why not?

Suppose a researcher wants to query for all observations between midnight and 1am. On how many of the boats will they need to run the query?

The researcher will likely need to run the query on all of the boats.
The researcher will likely need to run the query on only some of the boats.
Suppose a researcher wants to query for a specific observation, which occurred at exactly 2023-11-01 00:00:01.020. On how many of the boats will they need to run the query?

The researcher will need to run the query on all of the boats.
The researcher will need to run the query on only some of the boats.
Based on what you’ve learned from the above, from lecture, and from your own intuition, write 2–3 sentences that describe both reasons to adopt this approach and reasons not to adopt this approach. Write the sentences in answers.md, within the “Partitioning by Hash Value” section."
